# feat: Add Dark Mode Toggle

Implement a dark mode toggle in the application settings that allows users to switch between light and dark themes

## 📋 Summary

**User Story:** As a user, I want to toggle between light and dark themes so that I can use the application in different lighting conditions.

- Given dark mode is enabled, when I refresh the page, then the dark theme should persist
