# Copy this file to .env.server and fill in your actual values
# See GOOGLE_API_SETUP.md for detailed setup instructions

# Find this in your Google Cloud Console
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your_google_project_id_here

# NOTES
# =============================================================================
# 1. Never commit .env.server to Git - it contains sensitive credentials
# 2. The .gitignore file is already configured to exclude all .env* files
# 3. For Netlify deployment, use environment variables in Netlify dashboard
# 4. Make sure the service account JSON file is also in .gitignore
