# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Setup for PromptsGenie

## üöÄ Enhanced Coding Capabilities Activated!

Your PromptsGenie project now has supercharged AI coding capabilities through MCP integration.

## üìÅ Configuration Files Created

### Core Configuration
- `mcp.json` - Main MCP server configuration
- `.rules` - Project-specific coding standards and conventions

### Server Configurations
- `filesystem-config.json` - Secure file operation patterns
- `git-config.json` - Advanced Git operations and analysis
- `memory-config.json` - Persistent knowledge graph settings
- `github-setup.md` - GitHub integration instructions

### Storage
- `memory/` - Directory for persistent AI memory and context

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. GitHub Integration (Required)
1. Follow instructions in `github-setup.md`
2. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token
3. Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE` in `mcp.json` with your token

### 2. Verify MCP Servers
The following MCP servers are configured:
- **Filesystem**: Secure file operations across the project
- **Git**: Advanced repository operations and history analysis  
- **Memory**: Persistent knowledge graph and context retention
- **GitHub**: Repository management and API integration

### 3. Test Installation
Run this command to verify MCP servers are available:
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem --help
npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-git --help
npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory --help
npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-github --help
```

## üéØ Enhanced Capabilities

### Code Intelligence
- **Context Awareness**: AI remembers your coding patterns and preferences
- **Project Knowledge**: Deep understanding of PromptsGenie architecture
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies and suggests improvements based on project history

### Development Tools
- **Advanced Git Operations**: Commit analysis, branch tracking, merge conflict detection
- **Secure File Operations**: Safe file manipulation with defined access patterns
- **GitHub Integration**: Repository management, issue tracking, PR analysis

### Memory & Learning
- **Persistent Memory**: AI retains knowledge across sessions
- **Knowledge Graph**: Relationships between code components and patterns
- **Solution History**: Remembers previous fixes and optimizations

## üîç Verification Checklist

- [x] `.trae` directory created
- [x] MCP configuration files in place
- [x] Filesystem security patterns defined
- [x] Git operations configured
- [x] Memory system initialized
- [x] Project rules established
- [ ] GitHub token configured (manual step required)
- [ ] MCP servers tested (run test commands above)

## üö® Security Notes

- GitHub token provides access to your repositories - keep it secure
- Filesystem access is restricted to project directories only
- Memory data is stored locally in `.trae/memory/`
- Never commit actual tokens to version control

## üéâ What's Next?

Your AI coding assistant now has:
1. **Enhanced Context**: Understands PromptsGenie's React/Node.js architecture
2. **Memory Persistence**: Remembers your coding style and project patterns
3. **Advanced Tools**: Git analysis, GitHub integration, secure file operations
4. **Project Intelligence**: Follows established coding standards and conventions
